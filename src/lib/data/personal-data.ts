My path started in **fine arts**, before I dropped everything at **20** and moved to **Canada** to reinvent myself. What began as late nights of **self-study** grew into a passion for building **ethical AI** and **UX-centric** applications that solve real problems. I see myself as a **polymath** in progress, blending **tech**, **design**, and **business**. Based in **Toronto**, I'm driven to push boundaries while staying grounded in curiosity and ethics.",
